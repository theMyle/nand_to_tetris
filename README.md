# Nand To Tetris Project Progression

Building a general purpose computer from the ground (nand gates) up

- [x] => Implemented
- [ ] => Not yet implemented

## Zig Implementation

Recreating everything in zig just for fun. Also implementing virtual gates, memory, etc.. from the ground up.

### Elementary Logic Gates - Implemented ✅


### Arithmetic Logic Unit - Not yet implemented ❌
### Memory - Not yet implemented ❌
